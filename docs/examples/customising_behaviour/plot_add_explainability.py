Adding Explainability to Fusilli
################################################

Adding SHAP values using the shap library to fusilli.
Guidance includes for :
- Unimodal models
    - Tabular models
    - Image models (2D only)
- Multimodal models (tabular and tabular)
- Multimodal models (tabular and image)

.. warning::

    Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on SHAP values, I just recently starting using them with this library so hopefully this can help somebody else to get started.
